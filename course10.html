      <h3>Core modules</h3>
      <p><strong>Fine Art Studio 1: Processes and Materials (ART418)</strong><br>
        This introductory module introduces students to the diverse natures of fine art and the role of the studio within it. It aims to provide students with the skills to identify and investigate individual and collaborative interests and concerns through practical engagement in the studio and through interdisciplinary research; to develop students' capacities for self-criticism through informed debate; to develop student confidence in recognising and using processes and materials relevant to their developing practice; and to introduce practices of documentation. Lectures, seminars, and workshops support students to relate examples of contemporary fine art practice to their own, studio-based explorations of relevant concepts, material processes and techniques.</p>
      <p><strong>Interdisciplinary Approaches 1 (ART419)</strong><br>
        This practice-based module introduces students to interdisciplinarity and to how artists have worked collaboratively in multi-disciplinary, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary ways with researchers and communities. Students will learn a range of approaches and methods and will experiment with and test their artistic responses to themes that draw on interdisciplinary research.</p>
      <p><strong>Interdisciplinary Approaches 2 (ART420)</strong><br>
        This practice-based module enables students to consolidate their awareness of ideas and approaches to interdisciplinarity and to how artists have worked collaboratively in multi-disciplinary, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary ways with researchers and communities. Students will deepen their approaches and methods and will experiment with and test their artistic responses to a theme that draws on interdisciplinary work and develops out of Interdisciplinary Approaches 1.</p>
      <p><strong>Art Writing 1 (ART421)</strong><br>
        This module focuses on exhibition visiting and creative review writing to introduce key ideas, methods, and approaches in fine art practice. Students will begin to develop skills in creative-critical writing through being introduced to examples and excerpts of art writing. Students will visit local and online exhibitions as part of this module and will produce a collection of short experiments in art writing.</p>
      <p><strong>Creative Reading 1 (ART422)</strong><br>
        This module introduces key ideas, methods, and approaches within contemporary art practices through techniques of creative reading of critical texts. The focus is on concepts, methods and approaches that are current in contemporary art and are relevant to students’ emerging practices and will lead to a coherent expanded essay (choice of written, video, or audio) that evidences a sustained research process.</p>
      <h2>Year 2</h2>
      <p>Drawing on your work from the first year, you’ll now have confidence to follow your instincts, choose your own media, use your inspirations and intentions to outline project aims and research strategies. You’ll further develop your critical skills by reflecting on your own work and that of others. In groups, you will curate a selection of work for a public exhibition and engage in a professional placement or interdisciplinary residency. You’ll also make work in response to common challenges – environment, health and equality. There is also an opportunity to take part in an international exchange programme.</p>
      <h3>Core modules</h3>
      <p><strong>Fine Art Practice 2: Studio Experimentation and DIY Culture (ART522)</strong><br>
        This module provides an opportunity for students to develop a negotiated art practice through sustained studio experimentation and a DIY/DIWO (Do It Yourself / Do It With Others) culture, including strategies for navigating collaborative practices. The studio-based module will develop an awareness of contextual frameworks in relation to art practice and enable students to research and experiment with materials, processes, concepts and environments in preparation for a public show of art practice.</p>
      Interdisciplinary Art Practice 3: audiences and public interaction (ART523)
      
      This module provides an opportunity for students to develop an understanding of professional practice or links within a discipline of associated research through placement participation. Develop outputs that can be disseminated to a public audience that are appropriate to the student’s area of professional interaction, introduced through a series of seminars and/or workshops This module also is aimed at developing the student’s professional portfolio.
      <p><strong>Common Challenge: Interdisciplinary Art Practice 4 (ART524)</strong><br>
        This module provides an opportunity for students to develop and realise collaborative professional practice through interdisciplinary research grounded in placement and/or residency participation. There will be a specific focus on strategies for collaboration, community-based practice and social practice art. This will be introduced through a series of seminars and/or workshops. Students will work in groups with interdisciplinary partners to develop collaborative outputs that can be disseminated to a public audience.</p>
      <h3>Optional modules</h3>
      <p><strong>ADA International Exchange</strong><br>
        Critical studies 3: Close reading of influential text (ART520)
        This programme of seminars, tutorials and independent study will examine key theories and ideas which relate to contemporary fine art practice through close reading of selected texts. The influential texts will be used to explore areas of artistic inquiry as well as strategies for researching, writing and engaging in practical research within a group and individual framework.</p>
      <p><strong>Critical studies 4: writing as cultural practice (ART521)</strong><br>
        This programme of seminars, presentations, tutorials and independent study continues to explore key theories and ideas which relate to contemporary art practices. Selected works and texts, and modes of writing, will be used to explore areas of inquiry as methods of engaging in practical research within a group and individual framework.</p>
      <h2>Final year</h2>
      <p>In your final year, you will produce a comprehensive body of work, exploring its social and cultural context and the relationship between artist and audience. Deepen your knowledge of a specific area of artistic practice and its concepts through the common dissertation module, where you can develop critical and creative skills in an interdisciplinary setting. Continue to prepare for a career in art by developing a research portfolio and art publication for use when you graduate. Develop professional and transferable skills in collaborative arts administration and management through curation, design, marketing and installing your degree show.</p>
      <h3>Core modules</h3>
      <p><strong>Fine Art Practice 3: Research and Development for Public Exhibition (ART625)</strong><br>
        The students will develop a negotiated conceptual framework for individual and/or collaborative creative methods, with reference to contemporary practices, approaches and theories. The module will enable the development of student learning towards an increasingly independent enquiry into source material and appropriate practices, linked to critical research and professional practice.</p>
      <p><strong>Fine Art Practice 4: Public Exhibition (ART626)</strong><br>
        The students will realise a negotiated conceptual framework for individual and/or collaborative creative methods, with reference to contemporary practices, approaches and theories. The module will enable the development of student learning towards the realisation of an independent, practice-based enquiry into source material and appropriate professional practices, linked to critical research.
