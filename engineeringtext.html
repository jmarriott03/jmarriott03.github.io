	  <h2>Course details</h2>
<h2>Year 1</h2>
<p>In the first year of your mechanical engineering course, you will study alongside other engineering students to learn about the fundamental principles underpinning the subjects studied throughout the course. You will develop your mathematical skills and study engineering materiasls, structural mechanics and fluid mechanics. You will learn about generic design processes and computer-aided design, and work in a team to undertake a real-world design challenge. Laboratory sessions will form an important part of your learning.</p> 
<h3>Core modules</h3>

This module is aimed at students who may be undertaking an industrial placement in the third year of their programme. It is designed to assist students in their search for a placement and in their preparation for the placement itself.</p> 
<p><strong>ENGR101 Engineering Design</strong><br>
This module introduces students to engineering design practice appropriate to civil, marine and mechanical engineering disciplines. Students will develop sketching and technical drawing skills and use computer-aided design (CAD) tools to create digital models of technical systems. Working in a team, students will be tasked to create sustainable solutions to real-world technical design challenges.</p> 
<p><strong>ENGR102 Engineering Practice and Experimental Techniques</strong><br>
The mainly experimental basis of this module allows students to extend their engineering knowledge and practical competence using a guided, student-centred, and laboratory-based approach to develop fundamental understanding of a range of engineering topics. The module will help students acquire good study skills and competency in technical communication.</p> 
<p><strong>ENGR103 Engineering Science</strong><br>
This module introduces students to the fundamental scientific principles of fluid mechanics appropriate for civil, marine and mechanical engineering applications; the fundamental concepts of thermodynamics relating to the interaction between systems and their surroundings, including both flow and non-flow processes, heat engines, and mechanisms of heat transfer; and the fundamental principles of electrical engineering.</p> 
<p><strong>ENGR104 Engineering Mathematics</strong><br>
This module provides students with a number of fundamental mathematical skills, and techniques, which are essential for the analysis of engineering problems.</p>
<p><strong>ENGR105 Mechanics and Structures</strong><br>
This module introduces students to the fundamental scientific principles of engineering mechanics and structures appropriate for civil, marine and mechanical engineering applications. Deeper understanding of these scientific principles will be developed through practical applications using hand calculations and computer software tools as appropriate.</p> 
<p><strong>ENGR106 Engineering Materials</strong><br>
This module introduces students to a broad range of engineering materials appropriate for civil, marine and mechanical engineering applications. The module will consider the relationship between structure, manufacture and properties, presenting practical applications wherever appropriate. Students will also be introduced to standard material test methods.</p> 
<h2>Year 2</h2>
<p>The second year introduces subjects like control systems engineering and quality management while further developing your thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, mathematics and design skills. These subjects are explored in lectures, in laboratory sessions and workshops. At this point, you can opt in to the 'with composites' pathway.</p>
<h3>Core modules</h3>
<p><strong>MATS235 Materials &amp; Structural Integrity</strong><br>
This module introduces students to the structural assessment of a range of engineering materials. It includes both a study of the materials themselves as well as their likely failure mechanisms under load. The module will also develop the underpinning mathematical analysis required to quantify these effects in an appropriate manner.</p>
<p><strong>MECH233 Manufacturing Processes</strong><br>
This module provides students with a comprehensive introduction to manufacturing. It will cover both the fundamentals of forming, shaping, joining and traditional machining processes in relation to a range of engineering materials and the relationship between structure, manufacture and properties. It will also include hands-on workshop activities to reinforce understanding and to develop additional engineering competences.</p>
<p><strong>CONT222 Engineering Maths &amp; Control</strong><br>
This module provides engineering mathematical techniques and methods (Laplace transform and linear algebra) for the analysis of practical engineering problems and introduces classical control systems theory.</p>
<p><strong>MECH235 Mechanical Engineering Design &amp; Commercialisation</strong><br>
In this module, students develop and apply their engineering science knowledge in a practical design context. They learn to follow a structured design process to enhance creativity, logical analysis/decision making and commercial awareness. They apply this process to solve a design challenge. They also learn to use parametric calculations to optimise components/systems for specific design constraints. </p>
<p><strong>MECH234 Thermo-Fluids</strong><br>
This module will introduce student’s key concepts in thermodynamics and fluids mechanics theory (1st and 2nd laws) pertaining to mechanical engineering. It will also include an introduction to heat transfer and its application in design and performance of heat engines and other applications.</p>
<p><strong>MFRG209 Engineering Quality Management</strong><br>
This module provides the student with an understanding of the importance of Total Quality to a manufacturer, its measurement and some of the tools available to the designer/manager to ensure it is profitably achieved. It introduces the concept of the World-Class organisation, its culture and management as well as the international (ISO) management systems (quality, environment and H&amp;S) involved.</p>
<p><strong>BPIE215 Stage 2 Mechanical Placement Preparation</strong></p> 
<h2>Optional placement year</h2>
<p>By taking the opportunity to spend an optional year in paid employment whilst still a student engineer, you will obtain recordable professional experience, build a network of industry contacts and often obtain offers of summer work, sponsorship or employment on graduation. Our placements team will support you in finding a placement, and we have an extensive network of employers across all sectors.</p>
<p><strong>Optional modules BPIE335 Engineering Related Placement</strong></p>
<h2>Final year</h2>
<p>In your final year, you will deepen your understanding of computer aided engineering tools and control systems. You will also focus your specialism choosing to further your understanding of thermofluids and design methodology or choosing to study the theoretical and practical aspects of composites engineering on the 'with composites' pathway. Your dissertation project enables you to research the topics that interest you and will allow you to bring together all you have learnt so far.</p>
