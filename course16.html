        PHO501</p>
      <p>This module engages students in forms of contemporary photographic practice involving still and moving image, sound and text. A single multimedia time-based output is constructed over the course of the module. Emphasis is placed on developing work that is informed by an understanding of historical and contemporary lens-based practice and culture and associated contextual research (theoretical and practical).</p>
      <p><strong>Futures</strong><br>
        PHO502</p>
      <p>The module is designed to contribute the development of studentsâ€™ contextual understanding of their discipline, and focus this towards identifying personal career aspirations, means of sustainable career development, and the opportunities offered, directly and indirectly, by the industry.</p>
      <p><strong>Common Challenge: Collaboration</strong><br>
        PHO503</p>
      <p>The module offers the opportunity to students to look outwards, to engage or work with others collaboratively. Thematically, the research and project focus will relate to UN Sustainable Development Goals incorporating an interdisciplinary agenda. Student practice is developed through interaction, exchanging of ideas and actively researching/collaborating with an external individual, group or organisation.</p>
      <p><strong>Establishing</strong><br>
        Practice PHO504</p>
      <p>In this module, students negotiate a theme from which to develop a series of art/media/design works or artefacts.

      </ul>
      <h3>Core modules</h3>
      <p><strong>Common Dissertation: Critical Practices</strong><br>
        ADA600</p>
      <p>The module engages students in situating practice through research, contextualisation and critical reflection, in relation to their final stage study and post University aspirations. Programmes can offer: a traditional dissertation; preparation for an extended dissertation; situating existing practice; or the construction of a new body of work as practice-based research.</p>
      <p><strong>Negotiation</strong><br>
        PHO602</p>
      <p>In this module each student develops an experimental programme of photographic practice in negotiation with tutors, through careful reflection on personal aims and objectives for the final year of study.</p>
      <p><strong>Resolution</strong><br>
        PHO603</p>
      <p>After an initial period of self-initiated preparation, research and consultation, students prepare and submit a written proposal for the consolidation of a body of work. Subject to the approval of the module team, the student undertakes a period of self-negotiated study leading to the production of a substantial body of work, supported by a critical reflection.</p>
      <h2>Optional modules</h2>
      <p><strong>Extended Dissertation</strong><br>
        PHO604</p>
      <p>This module completes the Photography research syllabus with an extended essay, researched and written by each student. Students have the opportunity to research and reflect on a subject of their choice, within an area associated with their practice discipline.</p>
      <p><strong>Professional Futures</strong><br>
        PHO605</p>
      <p>Delivered across the third and final year, this module is geared towards students focussing on their career aspirations post university and researching, collating, reflecting and networking to create an â€˜exit-strategyâ€™ that will enable them to be â€˜ready and ableâ€™ and to achieve potential employability.</p>
