If needed, the matter can be escalated formally.</li>

    <!-- Question 1 -->
    <h2>1/10</h2>
    <h3>During a team meeting, James makes a joke about wheelchair users needing "special treatment" while discussing reasonable adjustments for a new team member who uses a wheelchair. When a colleague points out that the comment is inappropriate and offensive, James dismisses it, saying he was "just joking" and that "people are too sensitive these days."</h3>
    <h3>What type of behaviour could this be?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="iconfont darkorange" aria-hidden="true">3</span>Disability harassment. James’ comment about wheelchair users needing “special treatment” creates an offensive environment and violates the dignity of individuals with disabilities.</li>
      <li><span class="iconfont" aria-hidden="true">2</span>James is simply making a joke that shouldn't be taken seriously. It's just a light-hearted comment, and the issue is being blown out of proportion.</li>
      <li><span class="iconfont" aria-hidden="true">2</span>Wait for the issue to resolve itself. If it happens again, James will eventually realise his comments are inappropriate on his own.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <!-- Question 2 -->
    <h2>2/10</h2>
    <h3>A staff member approaches you and discloses that they are being subjected to offensive comments regarding their religious beliefs by a colleague. They don't feel comfortable speaking directly to the individual. They're considering reporting it, but are unsure how to proceed and are concerned it won't be taken seriously.</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="iconfont" aria-hidden="true">2</span>Advise the staff member to find another job if it’s too difficult to work with that colleague</li>
      <li><span class="iconfont" aria-hidden="true">2</span>Ignore the complaint, as it might not be serious and reporting it will likely make things worse</li>
      <li><span class="iconfont darkorange" aria-hidden="true">3</span>Reassure them that their concerns will be taken seriously and explain the reporting process and support available to them</li>
    </ul>
    
    <!-- Question 3 -->
    <h2>3/10</h2>
    <h3>During online team meetings, one colleague regularly posts comments in the chat about the appearance of female colleagues. While the colleague may view these as harmless compliments, the behaviour has made several women uncomfortable, leading them to turn off their cameras during meetings.</h3>
    <h3>What is the most appropriate course of action to take in this situation?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="iconfont darkorange" aria-hidden="true">3</span>If you feel able to, approach the colleague privately and explain that their comments are inappropriate and that they make people uncomfortable.<br>
        <br>
        If that doesn't resolve the matter, or if you are not comfortable/it's not appropriate to speak to the colleague directly, speak to your manager or HR Partner, or use the Speak Up tool.</li>
      <li><span class="iconfont" aria-hidden="true">2</span>Suggesting that it’s just harmless fun, and that people should not take things too seriously.</li>
      <li><span class="iconfont" aria-hidden="true">2</span>Ignore the behaviour since the colleague is not intending to offend anyone, and it is up to the female colleagues to address it if they are uncomfortable.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <!-- Question 4 -->
    <h2>4/10</h2>
    <h3>Sarah, a PhD student, tells you her supervisor has been sending her personal messages on social media, invited her to dinner at his home, and made comments about wanting to "get to know her better outside of academia". When she doesn't respond positively, he started criticising her research more harshly.</h3>
    <h3>What type of situation could this be?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="iconfont" aria-hidden="true">2</span>Misunderstanding that can be resolved informally</li>
      <li><span class="iconfont darkorange" aria-hidden="true">3</span> Sexual harassment with potential victimisation</li>
      <li><span class="iconfont" aria-hidden="true">2</span> Normal Supervisor – Student relationship</li>
    </ul>
    
    <!-- Question 5 -->
    <h2>5/10</h2>
    <h3>A student approaches you and is visibly distressed. They tell you that another student has been sending them explicit messages late at night and making uncomfortable comments about their body during group work. The student says, "I just needed to tell someone, but I don't want to make this official"</h3>
    <h3>What is the most appropriate response?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="iconfont" aria-hidden="true">2</span> "I’m sorry you’re dealing with this, but I can’t really help unless you decide to make it official. You should just ignore the messages for now and focus on your work."</li>
      <li><span class="iconfont darkorange" aria-hidden="true">3</span> "I’m really sorry you’re going through this. It’s important you feel supported and safe. I can walk you through the options available and talk about how we can best support you. I’ll also show you the support services available to you."</li>
      <li><span class="iconfont" aria-hidden="true">2</span> "I’m really sorry this is happening. Can you please tell me every detail of the explicit messages? I need to assess how serious this is so that we can decide on the right action. It’s important we know exactly what was said."</li>
    </ul>
    
    <!-- Question 6 -->
    <h2>6/10</h2>
    <h3>A Professor repeatedly tells female students that they "need to be more assertive" and "speak up like the men do" during discussions. The professor also consistently gives these female students lower marks, saying they "don’t contribute as effectively" to the class discussions, despite no evidence that their academic abilities or contributions are any worse than their male peers. The female students feel uncomfortable and singled out, but are unsure how to address the situation.</h3>
    <h3>What kind of behaviour could this be seen as?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="iconfont" aria-hidden="true">2</span> The professor is just trying to encourage female students to participate more. It’s not harassment; it’s meant to help them perform better academically.</li>
      <li><span class="iconfont darkorange" aria-hidden="true">3</span> This is an example of gender-based harassment. The professor is unfairly targeting female students based on gender stereotypes, such as expecting them to behave like their male counterparts. This treatment creates a hostile environment for the students.</li>
      <li><span class="iconfont" aria-hidden="true">2</span> The professor is offering constructive feedback on how to participate more in discussions. The comments about speaking up more are about improving their communication, not harassment. The lower marks are likely based on their level of participation, not gender.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <!-- Question 7 -->
    <h2>7/10</h2>
    <h3>After witnessing a colleague making discriminatory comments about a student's religious practices during a department meeting, you reported the incident. Since then, you notice your manager no longer invites you to team meetings, your annual leave requests are frequently rejected without explanation, and you received an unusually harsh performance development review with no clear evidence to back it up.</h3>
    <h3>Could this be an example of victimisation?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="iconfont" aria-hidden="true">2</span> These issues are unrelated to your report and are normal management decisions based on performance. It is not victimisation, but rather standard decisions regarding your work.</li>
      <li><span class="iconfont" aria-hidden="true">2</span> You're being oversensitive. These management decisions are standard and likely have nothing to do with your report. There’s no indication that your manager’s actions are linked to your disclosure.</li>
      <li><span class="iconfont darkorange" aria-hidden="true">3</span> This could be a case of victimisation. The negative changes in treatment (being excluded from meetings, having leave requests rejected, receiving harsh performance reviews) seem to be occurring after your protected disclosure, which could suggest retaliation for reporting the discriminatory comments.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <!-- Question 8 -->
    <h2>8/10</h2>
    <h3>A lecturer frequently engages with students after class, offering personal relationship advice, discussing private matters unrelated to their academic work, and sharing personal experiences. Recently, the lecturer has begun meeting with several students on weekends for casual outings that are unrelated to academic topics. One student has expressed concern that the lecturer's behaviour has become overly familiar and crosses a professional boundary, making them feel uncomfortable.</h3>
    <h3>Has the lecturer crossed a professional boundary?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="iconfont" aria-hidden="true">2</span> No – Sharing personal advice and meeting students outside of class is part of being a mentor and helps students open up.</li>
      <li><span class="iconfont" aria-hidden="true">2</span> No – The lecturer is just trying to be supportive and helpful outside of class.</li>
      <li><span class="iconfont darkorange" aria-hidden="true">3</span> Yes – Offering personal relationship advice, discussing private matters unrelated to academic work, and meeting students outside of class hours blurs professional boundaries.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <!-- Question 9 -->
    <h2>9/10</h2>
    <h3>During a university event, an external speaker repeatedly makes sexually inappropriate comments about a staff member’s appearance. These remarks make the staff member feel humiliated and deeply uncomfortable. When the staff member addresses the comments, the speaker dismisses the behaviour as "just a joke". The staff member wants to escalate the situation but feels unsure about whether to report the incident, as the speaker is from an external organisation.</h3>
    <h3>What do you think?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="iconfont darkorange" aria-hidden="true">3</span> The colleague should report the incident.</li>
      <li><span class="iconfont" aria-hidden="true">2</span> Since the speaker is an external individual, the situation should be ignored.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <!-- Question 10 -->
    <h2>10/10</h2>
    <h3>Dr. Smith consistently interrupts Dr. Jones during faculty meetings, dismisses their research proposals without consideration, and assigns them administrative duties that are below their pay grade. When Dr. Jones tries to contribute to discussions, Dr. Smith rolls their eyes and makes comments like "here we go again". This has been happening for three months.</h3>
    <h3>What kind of behaviour could this be seen as?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="iconfont" aria-hidden="true">2</span> Normal workplace disagreement</li>
      <li><span class="iconfont darkorange" aria-hidden="true">3</span> Bullying</li>
      <li><span class="iconfont" aria-hidden="true">2</span> Poor management style</li>
